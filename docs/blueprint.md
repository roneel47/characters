# **App Name**: Chibi Clash Cards

## Core Features:

- Card Generation: Generate a Chibi Battle Card image with a LLM tool based on a textual description.
- Card Display: Display generated Chibi Battle Cards in a digital card format.
- Theme Selection: Provide users with a selection of themes to use for generating cards (e.g., pirate, ninja, ice cream, robot, unicorn, wizard, cat).
- Attribute Customization: Allow users to input custom values for Attack and Defense to display on the card.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF9933) to create a fun, energetic and playful theme.
- Background color: Light peach (#FFE5CC) to create a warm, soft background that doesn't overshadow the colorful characters.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#66B2FF) as a complementary contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for card names and attribute values to create a playful aesthetic.
- Use cute badges at the bottom corners to display Attack and Defense values, adopting a rounded, cartoonish style.
- Center the chibi character in the card. Include a soft glowing border around the card frame, with the background thematically matched to the character.
- Implement subtle animations for card reveals or attribute changes, adding to the game-friendly feel.
